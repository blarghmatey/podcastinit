- Overview - Interview with Jonathan Slenders
###Interview with Jonathan Slenders
- Introductions
- How were you first introduced to Python? -Chris
- What inspired you to create the python-prompt-toolkit?
- What are some design considerations that you made when building prompt-toolkit?
    - Make minimal use of inheritance
        - Overly strong coupling
        - Better clarity for the API of your library
        - Completely event driven / asynchronous
        - No global state
    - ptpython completion benefits from asynchrony - The jedi completion library is too slow - completion happens in its own thread
- You have built a number of projects that use the prompt-toolkit as a core component, did you have them in mind from the beginning, or are they experiments to test the capabilities of the toolkit?
    - tmux rewrite in Python, abandoned, original motivation for prompt-toolkit
    - [ptpython](https://github.com/jonathanslenders/ptpython)
    - [pgcli](https://github.com/dbcli/pgcli)
    - [ptpdb](https://github.com/jonathanslenders/ptpdb)
    - [pyvim](https://github.com/jonathanslenders/pyvim)
- Do you intend to bring PyVim to feature parity with Vim, or is it just intended for experimentation?
    - Short answer: Don't know - but will probably never be in full parity with Vim
- What inspired you to create ptpython and why did you choose to make it a stand-along project rather than extending iPython?
- How difficult was it to integrate with IPython and what were the benefits?
    - IPython has its own event loop - this presented difficulties as prompt-toolkit has its own as well
- What are some of the most interesting uses that you have seen of the prompt-toolkit?
    - PyVim - really challenged the design
    - pgcli
