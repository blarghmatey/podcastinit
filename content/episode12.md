### Interview with Eric Schles
* Introductions
* How did you get introduced to Python?
* What inspired you to take up the fight against slavery? Is there personal story behind this choice?
* Some of your work touches on the "Deep Web". Can you provide listeners with some context around what that term means and role it plays in what you do?
  * Tor .onion sites (Hidden Services) are examples
  * Anonymous Web Experience
  * Anonymity allows for illegal, immoral things like buying selling people
  * Conceptually very important idea
  * Bruce Schneier - Web technologies need to be more privacy aware
  * Like a really scary version of "The Internet of the Old Days"
  * Photos of young, exploited men and women
  * Pedophiles are building communities, having parties through these hidden services
  * Eric feels that Tor is an extreme
    * Feels there had to be a way to protect the rights of legitimate while protecting against pedophiles
    * Maybe a voting system?
    * The Tor project feels that any compromise lessens the that's so important for people in embattled or countries (Worded that poorly -Chris)
    * No metrics on the amount of pedophilia that actually happens Tor - probably a lot
  * Sexually abused victims of trafficking grow up damanged unable to do anything else
    * Consumers of this type of porn were often themselves victims sexual abuse
    * Structural dissonance which exists to create this problem society needs to be addressed
    * Google puts the number to the anti-trafficking hotline at top of any trafficking search results
  * Darren (Derek?) Hayes - redirect to trafficking resources when viewing advertisements for victims trafficking
* Why did you choose Python as opposed to any other tool for your search engine?
  * Needed solutions quickly with the ability to evolve as needed
  * Able to rapidly develop and incorporate new features rapidly
  * Easy to scale as needed
  * Flask is easier to prototype and iterate with
  * Python data science tools make the analysis easy
  * Able to finish a 2 year C++ project in 3 weeks using Python
  * Doing data science in Ruby is challenging
  * Pandas Dataframe galvanized the creation of a lot of other useful tools
  * [Vincent](https://github.com/wrobstory/vincent) - write Python which compiles to D3
* Can you provide a high level description of the technical details the search engine that you created, and what it's like to with Tor through Python?
  * Directed search engine
  * "It would be like if you went to Google but everything watched was Porn which you were uncomfortabl seeing and you sad"
  * Get most case information through regular old detective work
  * Person arrested / in holding yields phone number, other attributes that can feed the search engine
  * Google can't scrape the deep web
  * Memex tool indexes the deep web - Eric's search engine uses that
  * Eric does design work for the Memex project
  * Developed by the amazing Chris White
  * Eric's search engine uses the Tor driver in Selenium to .onion sites
* What are some of the technical and legal challenges that you experienced in the course of your work?
  * Most of the technical challenges are around automated processing
  * Legal structure provides some limits on what can be worked on
* Does your search engine try to infer who might be engaged in work voluntarily as opposed to those being forced into it their will?
  * No, because they get all their case referrals from detective work
  * You have to have been hospitalized or in some other way come the attention of the authorities for being deprived of rights
  * Trafficking looks very different in different cultures
  * Global similarities
  * Afraid to say why if hurt
  * Forced into having sex against your will
  * Clear patterns of indication
  * Urban versus Suburban versus Rural
  * Fracking towns
  * Demographics are very different - mostly men very women, LOTS of ads for sex workers
  * Only helping people that want to be helped
* What was the most surprising fact you uncovered as part of research?
  * Imagery of exploited children is so depressing and sad
* Without revealing anything you shouldn't, are you aware of being set free as a result of your work?
  * "Not my work, our work"
  * Not an individual effort
  * lawyers, analysts, larger DAs office
* Given the complicated socio-economic aspects of human and prosecution of those who are responsible, can you discuss of the moral and ethical considerations that you have confronted with while building these tools?
  * Privacy is the biggest concern
  * Open source book to teach colleagues at the DA's office how program to in Python
  * Sometimes Eric works at [Civic Hall](http://civichall.org/)
* Are there any projects out there that you consider similar to you are working on?
  * Thorn's [Spotlight tool](https://www.wearethorn.org/spotlight/)
  * [Memex Project](http://opencatalog.darpa.mil/MEMEX.html)
  * [Polaris Project](http://www.polarisproject.org/)
  * [Datakind](http://www.datakind.org/) Anti Trafficking
  * [dosomething.org](https://www.dosomething.org/) - more broadly focused - help center for teens
  * [RescueForensics - stage startup](http://techcrunch.com/2015/02/20/software-eats-sex-trafficking-ycs-rescue-forensics-aids-law-enforcement-in-finding-victims/)
* What would it take for other municipalities and law agencies to get started with using your tools?
