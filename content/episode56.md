### Summary
One of the biggest new trends in technology is the Internet of Things and one of the driving forces is the wealth of new sensors and platforms that are being continually introduced. In this episode we spoke with the founder and head engineer of one such platform named Onion. The Omega board is a new hardware platform that runs OpenWRT and lets you configure it using a number of languages, not least of which is Python.

<p>I’m excited to tell you about a new sponsor of the show, Rollbar.</p>

<p>
One of the frustrating things about being a developer, is dealing with errors… <i>(sigh)</i>

<ul>
<li>Relying on users to report errors</li>
<li>Digging thru log files trying to debug issues</li>
<li>A million alerts flooding your inbox ruining your day...</li>
</ul>

With Rollbar’s full-stack error monitoring, you get the context, insights and control you need to find and fix bugs faster. It's easy to get started tracking the errors and exceptions in your stack.
You can start tracking production errors and deployments in 8 minutes - or less, and Rollbar works with all major languages and frameworks, including Ruby, Python, Javascript, PHP, Node, iOS, Android and more.
You can integrate Rollbar into your existing workflow such as sending error alerts to Slack or Hipchat, or automatically create new issues in Github, JIRA, Pivotal Tracker etc.
