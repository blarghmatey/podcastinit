### Interview with PEP editors
- Introductions
- How did you get introduced to Python? - Chris
- For anyone who isn't familiar with them, can you explain what a PEP is and how they influence the Python language? - Tobias

- How has the PEP process evolved to meet challenges posed by changes in the Python community? - Chris
- How many reviewers are there and how did each of you end up in that role? Is there a set number of editors that must be maintained and if so how did you arrive at that number? - Tobias
- What mistakes have other communities made when creating similar processes, and how has PEP learned from those mistakes? - Chris
- There are different categories for PEPs. Can you describe what those are and how you arrived at that ontology? - Tobias
- Is there any significance to the numbering system used for identifying different PEPs? - Tobias
- How does the PEP process maintain its sense of humor (e.g. PEP 20) while being sure to be taken seriously where it really counts? - Chris
- Along the lines of humorous PEPs, can you share the story of PEP 401? - Tobias
