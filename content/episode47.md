### Summary
Efene is a language that runs on the Erlang Virtual Machine (BEAM) and is inspired by the Zen of Python. It is intended as a bridge language that serves to ease the transition into the Erlang ecosystem for people who are coming from languages like Python. In this episode I spoke with Mariano Guerra, the creator of Efene, about how Python influenced his design choices, why you might want to use it, and when Python is the better tool.

### Interview with Mariano Guerra
- Introductions
- How did you get introduced to Python? - Chris
- So Efene is a language that runs on the BEAM VM which you say was at least partially inspired by the Zen of Python. Can you explain in greater detail in what form that inspiration manifested and some of the process involved in the creation of Efene? - Tobias
- What inspired you to create Efene and what problems does it solve? - Tobias
- How does Efene compare to other BEAM based languages such as Elixir? - Tobias
- When would a Python developer want to consider using Efene? - Tobias
- What benefits does the BEAM provide that can't be easily replicated in the Python ecosystem? - Tobias
- Does the Efene language ease the transition to a more functional mindset for developers who are already familiar with Python paradigms? - Tobias
- I understand that you are experimenting with another language implementation that runs on the BEAM. Can you describe that project and compare it to Efene? What were your inspirations? - Tobias
