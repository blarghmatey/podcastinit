        *  ... Implemented in Python
	*  How did you get started as the organizer for Boston Python Meetup?
	    *  History is long and varied (Why is this switching to numbers?
	    *  Started - 6 people sitting around a coffee table
	    *  5 or 6 years
	    *  Co-organizers Jessica McKeller
		*  Built structures to help keep the community goingr
		*  Weekend Python Workshop
		    *  People 'adjacent' to the male members - wives, mothers, etc.
		*  "What comes next" from weekend workshops - became Project Night
	*  How much of your time ends up being dedicated to the Python community? 
	    *  Also maitainer of coverage.py
	    *  Active on Freenode IRC \#python
	    *  20 hours a week
	*  What are your goals for the Boston Python community? 
	    *  Continue to grow
	    *  More events, different events?
		*  Chicago UG very active - 1 on 1 mentoring program
		*  Smaller events - 5 person events - study groups
		    *  All levels not just beginners
		    *  Computational Biologists - study genomics
			*  Three user groups
			    *  Pyladies Boston
			    *  DJango Boston
			    *  Boston Python Meetup
	*  What do you find to be the most important thing(s) for building a healthy community (particularly in reference to programming)? 
	    * Consistency - good to know what to expect
	    * Pick a cadence - don't burn out
	*  Speakers aren't superheroes, they're just people. 'Everyone has at least one talk in them'.
	* Value in having a blog, twitter stream - people talk back to you and  by correcting your mistakes everyone benefits.
	*  How do you keep people engaged outside of the monthly meetings? 
	    *  Meetup.com - requires moderation
	    *  python.org mailing lists - unmoderated - low traffic
	    *  Need to do more in that regard
	*  What do you like the most/least about the Python community? 
	    *  Communities can improve - IRC has gotten better
		*  Turmoil on PSF mailing list over election for directors
		*  How do you strike a balance between sponsors and the rest of the community? Do you have policies around sponsored presentations / talks? 
		*  Tend not to do sponsored talks
		*  Microsoft NERD - great benefit to Boston Python
		*  Provides monthly space for the group
		*  1 minute slots for sponsors
		*  No sales pitches
	*  What are the steps I can take to start my own tech community? 
	    *  How can you get the word out?
		*  Meetup.com is useful
	    *  People like free food and beer :)
	    *  Be predictable. Pick something sustainable
	*  What is the State of Python, from your perspective? 
	    *  No signs of slowing down
	    *  Ruby people are moving to other environments
	    *  Python people are still using Python
	    *  Python 2 to 3 conflict is unfortunate - transition could have been handled more smoothly
	    *  Python 3 ecosystem is getting much better
	    *  Next big drama - type hinting proposal
		*  Appears to be contrary to one of the basics tenets of the language at first blush
	*  Do you feel that Boston will ever have its own regional Python conference? 
	    *  Toyed with bid to bring Pycon to Boston
		*  Would require someone stepping up to do it
		*  Not sure how a regional conference 'feels' as a local event
		*  Try to have Boston Python be like a year long conference all year long
		*  Huge undertaking
