    *  5 or 6 years
    *  Co-organizer Jessica McKeller
       *  Built structures to help keep the community goingr
    *  Weekend Python Workshop
        *  People 'adjacent' to the male members - wives, mothers, etc.
    *  "What comes next" from weekend workshops - became Project Night
*  How much of your time ends up being dedicated to the Python community?
    *  Also maitainer of [coverage.py](http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/)
    *  Active on Freenode IRC \#python
    *  20 hours a week
*  What are your goals for the Boston Python community?
    *  Continue to grow
    *  More events, different events?
    *  [chipy](http://www.chipy.org/) - Chicago UG very active - 1 on 1 mentoring program
    *  Smaller events - 5 person events - study groups
        *  All levels not just beginners
        *  Computational Biologists - study genomics
        *  Three user groups
            *  Pyladies Boston
            *  DJango Boston
            *  Boston Python Meetup
*  What do you find to be the most important thing(s) for building a healthy community (particularly in reference to programming)?
    * Consistency - good to know what to expect
    * Pick a cadence - don't burn out
*  Speakers aren't superheroes, they're just people. 'Everyone has at least one talk in them'.
* Value in having a blog, twitter stream - people talk back to you and  by correcting your mistakes everyone benefits.
*  How do you keep people engaged outside of the monthly meetings?
    *  [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/) - requires moderation
    *  [python.org mailing lists](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo) - unmoderated - low traffic
    *  Need to do more in that regard
*  What do you like the most/least about the Python community?
    *  Communities can improve - IRC has gotten better
    *  Turmoil on PSF mailing list over election for directors
*  How do you strike a balance between sponsors and the rest of the community? Do you have policies around sponsored presentations / talks?
    *  Tend not to do sponsored talks
    *  [Microsoft NERD](https://microsoftnewengland.com/) - great benefit to Boston Python
    *  Provides monthly space for the group
    *  1 minute slots for sponsors
    *  No sales pitches
*  What are the steps I can take to start my own tech community?
    *  How can you get the word out?
    *  Meetup.com is useful
    *  People like free food and beer :)
    *  Be predictable. Pick something sustainable
*  What is the State of Python, from your perspective?
    *  No signs of slowing down
    *  Ruby people are moving to other environments
    *  Python people are still using Python
    *  Python 2 to 3 conflict is unfortunate - transition could have been handled more smoothly
    *  Python 3 ecosystem is getting much better
    *  Next big drama - type hinting proposal
    *  Appears to be contrary to one of the basics tenets of the language at first blush
*  Do you feel that Boston will ever have its own regional Python conference?
    *  Toyed with bid to bring Pycon to Boston
    *  Would require someone stepping up to do it
    *  Not sure how a regional conference 'feels' as a local event
    *  Try to have Boston Python be like a year long conference all year long
    *  Huge undertaking
