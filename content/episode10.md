### Interview with Brian Granger and Fernando Perez

*  Introductions
*  How did you get introduced to Python? - Chris
*  For anyone who may not have heard of or used IPython, can you describe what it is?
*  How challenging was it to port IPython to Python 3?
    *  [Thomas Kluyver](https://twitter.com/takluyver)
*  What prompted the name change from IPython to Project Jupyter and were there any associated changes in the project itself?
    *  Name inspired by Julia, Python and R - the three programming languages of data science
*  Data scientists have adopted the use of IPython notebooks in their work on a large scale, what is it about notebooks that lend themselves to this particular problem domain?
    *  [Bayesian methods for Hackers - Cameron Davidson-Pilon](http://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/)
    *  [Signal processing in Python](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319013411)
    *  [O'Reilly added support for notebooks into Atlas publishing platform](https://beta.oreilly.com/ideas/jupyter-at-oreilly)
*  IPython Notebook seems like an incredible tool for educators is advanced fields. Have you seen wide spread adoption in this area and is it a focus for the project?
    *  [NBGrader - notebook grader](https://github.com/jupyter/nbgrader)
*  Github recently added the ability to [render notebooks in a repo](http://blog.jupyter.org/2015/05/07/rendering-notebooks-on-github/). Did you work with them to build that integration?
*  What are some of the most interesting uses of IPython notebooks that you have seen?
    *  Gallery of interesting notebooks on the [wiki](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks)
        *  [Reproducible academic publications](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks#reproducible-academic-publications)
        *  Couple of dozen scientific papers, some very high profile
    *  Educational notebooks on various subjects
    *  Great learning resource, as well as entertaining
    *  [MOOC taught between distributed team on Open EdX using IPython notebooks about numerical computing with Python](https://github.com/numerical-mooc/numerical-mooc)
    *  Peter Norvig collection of IPython notebooks
        *  [Includes analysis of traveling salesman problem](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/norvig.com/ipython/TSPv3.ipynb)
    *  [notebooks.codeneuro.org](http://notebooks.codeneuro.org/)- time series data analysis <- Couldn't get this to work. -Chris
*  Are there any notable projects that use IPython as one of their components?
    *  [KBase for computational biology](https://bcrc.bio.umass.edu/courses/spring2012/micbio/micbio660/content/ipython-and-systems-biology-knowledgebase-kbase)

    * [Wakari from Continuum Analytics](https://wakari.io/) - hosted IPython with computing environment
    * Rackspace hosts TempNB and other IPython services
* Where do you see Project Jupyter going in the future? Are there any particular new features you'd like to see added? - Tobias
    *  One of the biggest targeted features is real-time collaboration
        *  Prototyped by engineers from Google
    *  More modular UI and architecture
    *  Multi-user deployments with [Jupyter Hub](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyterhub)
* A few weeks ago we interviewed Jonathan Slenders who wrote ptpython, which brings IDE like capabilities to interactive Python. Have you ever considered including this in IPython?
* What are some of the features that an average user might not know about?
* Is there anything in particular that you would like to ask our listeners for help with?
    *  Pitch in with the development effort
    *  Organize community events on behalf of IPython/Jupyter
    *  Be patient while documentation improves :)
