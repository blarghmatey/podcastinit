### Interview with Brian Granger and Fernando Perez

*  Introductions
*  How did you get introduced to Python? - Chris
*  For anyone who may not have heard of or used IPython, can you describe what it is?
*  How challenging was it to port IPython to Python 3?
    *  [Thomas Kluyver](https://twitter.com/takluyver)
*  What prompted the name change from IPython to Project Jupyter and were there any associated changes in the project itself?
    *  Name inspired by Julia, Python and R - the three programming languages of data science
*  Data scientists have adopted the use of IPython notebooks in their work on a large scale, what is it about notebooks that lend themselves to this particular problem domain?

*  IPython Notebook seems like an incredible tool for educators is advanced fields. Have you seen wide spread adoption in this area and is it a focus for the project?
    *  [NBGrader - notebook grader](https://github.com/jupyter/nbgrader)
*  Github recently added the ability to [render notebooks in a repo](http://blog.jupyter.org/2015/05/07/rendering-notebooks-on-github/). Did you work with them to build that integration?
*  What are some of the most interesting uses of IPython notebooks that you have seen?
    *  Gallery of interesting notebooks on the [wiki](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks)

        *  Couple of dozen scientific papers, some very high profile
    *  Educational notebooks on various subjects
    *  Great learning resource, as well as entertaining

* Where do you see Project Jupyter going in the future? Are there any particular new features you'd like to see added? - Tobias
    *  One of the biggest targeted features is real-time collaboration
        *  Prototyped by engineers from Google
    *  More modular UI and architecture
    *  Multi-user deployments with [Jupyter Hub](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyterhub)
* A few weeks ago we interviewed Jonathan Slenders who wrote ptpython, which brings IDE like capabilities to interactive Python. Have you ever considered including this in IPython?
* What are some of the features that an average user might not know about?
* Is there anything in particular that you would like to ask our listeners for help with?
    *  Pitch in with the development effort
    *  Organize community events on behalf of IPython/Jupyter
    *  Be patient while documentation improves :)
