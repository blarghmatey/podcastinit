### Interview with Stuart Mumford
- Introductions
- How did you get introduced to Python? - Chris
- Can you explain what the research and applications of solar physics are and how SunPy facilitates those activities? - Tobias
- What was your inspiration for the SunPy project and what are you using it for in your research? - Tobias
- Can you tell us what SunPy's map and light curve classes are and how they might be used? - Chris
- Are there any considerations that you need to be aware of when writing software libraries for practitioners of the hard sciences that would be different if the target audience were software engineers? - Tobias
- Can SunPy consume data directly from telescopes and other observational apparatus? - Chris
- I noticed on the project site that SunPy leverages AstroPy internally. Can you describe the relationship between the two projects and why someone might want to use SunPy in place of or in addition to AstroPy? - Tobias
- Looking at the documentation I got the impression that there is a fair amount of visual representation of data for analysis. Can you describe some of the challenges that has posed? Is there integrated support for project Jupyter and are there other graphical environments that SunPy supports? - Tobias
- What are some of the most interesting applications that SunPy has been used for? - Chris
