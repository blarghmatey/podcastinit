<p>I’m excited to tell you about a new sponsor of the show, Rollbar.</p>
<p>
One of the frustrating things about being a developer, is dealing with errors… <i>(sigh)</i>
<ul>
<li>Relying on users to report errors</li>
<li>Digging thru log files trying to debug issues</li>
<li>A million alerts flooding your inbox ruining your day...</li>
</ul>
With Rollbar’s full-stack error monitoring, you get the context, insights and control you need to find and fix bugs faster. It's easy to get started tracking the errors and exceptions in your stack.
You can start tracking production errors and deployments in 8 minutes - or less, and Rollbar works with all major languages and frameworks, including Ruby, Python, Javascript, PHP, Node, iOS, Android and more.
You can integrate Rollbar into your existing workflow such as sending error alerts to Slack or Hipchat, or automatically create new issues in Github, JIRA, Pivotal Tracker etc.

### Interview with K Lars Lohn
- Introductions
- How did you get introduced to Python?
- You have an interesting pair of articles on your website that attempt to detail how you perceive code and why you think that formatting should be configured in a manner analogous to CSS. Can you explain a bit about how your particular perception affects the way that you program?
- On your website you have some images of incredibly detailed artwork that are actually mazes. Can you describe some of your creation process for those?
- What is it about mazes that keeps you interested in them and how did you first start using them as a form of visual art?
- At Mozilla you have helped to create a project called Socorro which utilizes complexity analysis for correlating stacktraces. How did you conceive of that approach to error monitoring?
- Can you describe how Socorro is architected and how it works under the covers?
- At this year’s PyCon US you presented the closing keynote and it was one of the most engaging talks that I’ve seen. Where did you get the inspiration for the content and the mixed media approach?
- For anyone who hasn’t seen it, you managed to weave together a very personal story with a musical performance, and some applications of complexity analysis into a seamless experience. How much did you have to practice before you felt comfortable delivering that in front of an audience?
- In addition to your technical career you are also very focused on living in a manner that is sustainable and in tune with your environment. What kinds of synergies and conflicts exist between your professional and personal philosophies?
