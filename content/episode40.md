### Interview with Ben Darnell
- Introductions
- How did you get introduced to Python? - Chris
- What is Tornado and what sets it apart from other HTTP servers? - Chris
- How did you get involved with Tornado? - Ben
- What was the inspiration for the name? - Tobias
- Tornado was created before the recent focus on asynchronous applications. What prompted that design choice and when might someone care about using async in their development? - Tobias
- What is involved in creating an event loop and what are some of the specific design decisions that you made when implementing one for Tornado? - Tobias
- How does Tornado's event loop compare to other packages such as Twisted or the asyncio module in the standard library? - Tobias
- The web module appears to provide a minimal framework for developing web apps. How scalable are those capabilities and is there a recommended architecture for people using Tornado to develop web applications? - Tobias
- What are some use cases in which a developer might choose Tornado over other similar options? - Chris
- Could you please give our listeners an overview of Tornado's concurrency options including coroutines? - Chris
- I see that Tornado supports interoperability with the WSGI protocol and one of the use cases mentioned is for running a Django application alongside a Tornado app. Is that a common way for providing websocket capabilities alongside an existing web app? - Tobias
- I noticed that Tornado provides non-blocking versions of bare sockets and TCP connections. Are there any add-on packages available to simplify the use of various network protocols along the lines of what Twisted includes? - Tobias
- Please tell us about the transition of Tornado to Python 3. What obstacles did you face and how did you overcome them? - Chris
- Based on your issue tracker it looks like http2 support is definitely on the roadmap. Could you please detail your future plans in this area? - Chris
- What are some of the common "gotcha's" for people who are just starting to use Tornado? - Tobias
