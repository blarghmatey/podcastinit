### Summary
One of the great strengths of the Python community is the diversity of backgrounds that our practitioners come from. This week Lorena Mesa talks about how her focus on political science and civic engagement led her to a career in software engineering and data analysis. In addition to her professional career she founded the Chicago chapter of PyLadies, helps teach women and kids how to program, and was voted onto the board of the PSF.

<p>I’m excited to tell you about a new sponsor of the show, Rollbar.</p>
<p>
One of the frustrating things about being a developer, is dealing with errors… <i>(sigh)</i>
<ul>
<li>Relying on users to report errors</li>
<li>Digging thru log files trying to debug issues</li>
<li>A million alerts flooding your inbox ruining your day...</li>
</ul>
With Rollbar’s full-stack error monitoring, you get the context, insights and control you need to find and fix bugs faster. It's easy to get started tracking the errors and exceptions in your stack.
You can start tracking production errors and deployments in 8 minutes - or less, and Rollbar works with all major languages and frameworks, including Ruby, Python, Javascript, PHP, Node, iOS, Android and more.
You can integrate Rollbar into your existing workflow such as sending error alerts to Slack or Hipchat, or automatically create new issues in Github, JIRA, Pivotal Tracker etc.
