### Interview
- Introductions
- How did you get introduced to Python? - Chris
- What is the PyData organization, how does PyData London fit into it and what is your relationship with it? - Tobias
- In what ways does a PyData conference differ from a PyCon? - Tobias
- Does PyData do anything in particular to encourage users from disciplines that might not be aware of how much our community has to offer to choose the Python suite of data analysis tools? - Chris
- You have both spent a good portion of your careers using Python for working with and analyzing data from various domains. How has that experience evolved over the past several years as newer tools have become available? - Tobias
- For someone who is just getting started in the data analytics space, what advice can you give? - Tobias
- How can conferences like PyData help strengthen the bonds and synergies between the Python software community and the sciences? - Chris
- There are a number of different subtopics within the blanket categorization of data science. Is it difficult to balance the subject matter in PyData conferences and meetups to keep members of the audience from being alienated? - Tobias
- Data science is a young field and we've yet to see lots of examples of the successful use of data. How are London-based companies using data with Python? - Ian
- Is there a Python data science library you think needs a little love? - Emlyn
